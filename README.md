# Capstone-Project---Mushroom-Vision
Mushroom Vision: Penis Envy Mushroom Identification
Project Overview
Mushroom Vision is a machine learning project aimed at accurately identifying Penis Envy mushrooms from images. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to distinguish these specific mushrooms from others, with the goal of supporting mycologists, mushroom enthusiasts, and researchers in their identification tasks.

Key Features
Penis Envy Mushroom Identification: Utilizes a trained model to identify Penis Envy mushrooms with high accuracy.
Deep Learning Model: Employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from images and perform classification.
Image Augmentation: Enhances the dataset and model robustness using image augmentation techniques.
Technologies Used
NumPy: For handling high-level mathematical operations and supporting large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
TensorFlow: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning that provides comprehensive tools, libraries, and community resources.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It enables fast experimentation with deep neural networks.
Model Architecture
The project uses a Sequential model from Keras, incorporating layers such as Conv2D for convolutional operations, MaxPooling2D for pooling operations, Flatten for flattening the layer inputs, and Dense for fully connected layers. This architecture is designed to efficiently process and classify image data.

Data Preprocessing
ImageDataGenerator from Keras is used for real-time data augmentation, enhancing the diversity of the training set by applying various transformations like rotations, shifts, and flips. This approach helps in improving the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.

How to Use
Setup: Ensure you have TensorFlow, NumPy, and other required libraries installed.
Prepare Your Dataset: Organize your images into appropriate directories for training and validation.
Train the Model: Run the training script to start learning from your dataset.
Evaluate and Deploy: Assess the model's performance and deploy it for identifying Penis Envy mushrooms in new images.
Contributions
Contributions to Mushroom Vision are welcome. Whether it's improving the model's accuracy, expanding the dataset, or enhancing the codebase, your input can help advance this project further.
